## Solution for Module 3 Challenge

This site has been created as a tool to create passwords of various lengths (5-99 characters), as well as presenting the options for the password to contain uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and special characters.  Upon activating the program, windows are presented to the user asking about the different possibilities for the password.  Upon completion, the password is displayed in the text box on the page.
